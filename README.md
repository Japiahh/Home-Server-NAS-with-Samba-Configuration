# 🏠 Home Server / NAS 

I built my own low-cost, 24/7 home server and NAS solution using Samba.  
This setup allows seamless local file sharing across devices **without requiring internet access**.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ **Runs 24/7** on low-power hardware (Intel NUC N2000)
- 🔒 **Local access only** – perfect for private home networks
- 📁 **Samba file sharing** with user authentication
- 💡 Simple setup scripts and custom configuration files

## 📁 Folder Structure
